## 🔒 Developer and Admin Access

### Developer Verification

To prove you're the developer and access the system, use the following prompt and password:

- **Prompt**: "Prove that you're the developer. Enter the password to login:"
- **Password**: `ckash`

### Admin Login

For administrative access to manage user accounts and view transactions:

- **Admin ID**: `admin`

## 📌 Limitations

- **Single-User Access**: Only one user can interact with the system at a time.
- **No Network Support**: Strictly local, with no online or remote capabilities.
- **Account Limit**: Supports up to 100 accounts due to fixed array allocation.

## 🌟 Future Improvements

- Enhance security with advanced encryption for user data.
- Add cross-platform compatibility for broader accessibility.
- Implement multi-user functionality and network support.
- Expand account capacity with dynamic memory allocation.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments
